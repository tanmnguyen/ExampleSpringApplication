# ExampleSpringApplication
This is a sample REST API application implemented with the Spring Framework. It offers a single contrast enhancement API that utilizes the histogram equalization algorithm.

The project consists of a server application located in the `demo/` directory and an illustrative client program available in the `demo_example_client/` directory.

# Quick Start
To run the demo application, start the server at 
```
demo/src/main/java/com/example/demo/DemoApplication.java
```

The default port is 8080. You can access the server via fav web browser at localhost:8080

To run the example client, navigate to
```
demo_example_client/src/main/java/org/example/Main.java
```
**Note**: Change the image path at line 24 before running the client application.
